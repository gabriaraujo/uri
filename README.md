## ðŸ“‘ About
These are my solutions to URI Online Judge problems. Whenever possible I will try to add more solutions to this repository. Most problems are solved in 
<a href="https://github.com/gabriaraujo/uri/tree/master/cpp" target="_blank">C++</a>, but it is also possible to find solutions in 
<a href="https://github.com/gabriaraujo/uri/tree/master/python" target="_blank">Python</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/gabriaraujo/uri/tree/master/haskell" target="_blank">Haskell</a>.

The <a href="https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/" target="_blank">URI Online Judge</a> is a project that is being developed by the Computer Science Department of URI University. The main goal of the project is to provide programming practice and knowledge sharing. It contains more than 1,000 problems divided in 8 big categories. This division help the users to focus on specific programming topics. All problems are available in Portuguese and English. The URI Online Judge website also has public contests on a regular basis.

## ðŸ’¡ Why?
This repository is part of my personal studies and I would be very happy to receive feedback on the solutions, code, structure, anything that can make me a better developer!
